# IMDB Data Cleaning

This is a data cleaning process applied to a dirty IMDB dataset to run some light EDA, the dirty & cleaned dataset are available in the reopsitory for any one who desires to use them. I used Python with Jupyter Notebook as the IDE.

From the EDA I was able to tell that **the highest ranking movies didn't necessarily generate the most revenue**.

First I imported the necessary libraries and then imported the dataset into the Notebook.

I then proceeded to assign it a name and take a look at the properties of the data to get an overview of what type of data I'd be working with.

I could see there was missing data in some of the columns, some column names needed to be renamed, some dropped, some column data types were wrong and needed to be converted.
I applied the "rename", "drop" & "to_datetime" functions to make some of these changes.

I did a lot more cleaning that required a bit more maneuvering to replace the missing values by searching the internet for the appropriate data to input, transforming some individual rows in some columns. All written code is available in the attached python file in the repository.

After cleaning the dataset to a satisfactory level I decided to see if there was a positive correlation between the score and the income generated by the top 5 movies i.e. The higest earners were also those with the highest scores.

It turned out that wasn't the case as the top 5 earners and top 5 ranked scores didn't match. This means the highest earners weren't scored really great by most of the consumers of the movies who gave their reviews & ratings, on the other hand it could also mean not a lot of people watched the highest scored movies which would explain the disparity in the income they earned.
