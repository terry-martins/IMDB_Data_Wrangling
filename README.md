# IMDB Data Cleaning

This is a data cleaning process applied to a dirty IMDB dataset to run some light EDA, the dirty & cleaned dataset are available in the reopsitory for any one who desires to use them. I used Python with Jupyter Notebook as the IDE.

From the EDA I was able to tell that **the highest ranking movies didn't necessarily generate the most revenue**.

First I imported the necessary libraries and then imported the dataset into the Notebook.
