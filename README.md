# IMDB_Data_Wrangling

This is a data wrangling process applied to a dirty IMDB dataset to run some quick EDA, the dirty & cleaned dataset are available in the reopsitory for any one who desires to use them.

From the EDA I was able to tell that **the highest ranking movies didn't necessarily bring in the highest revenue**.
